# TOML schema reference

## People

Every member of a Rust team is represented by a file in the `people` directory.
The file structure is this:

```toml
name = "John Doe"  # Real name of the person (required)
github = "johndoe"  # GitHub username of the person (required)
github-id = 123456  # GitHub ID of the person (required)
zulip-id = 123456   # Zulip ID of the person (optional)
discord-id = 123456 # Discord ID of the person (optional)
# You can also set `email = false` to explicitly disable the email for the user.
# This will, for example, avoid adding the person to the mailing lists.
email = "john@doe.com"  # Email address used for mailing lists (optional)
irc = "jdoe"  # Nickname of the person on IRC, if different than the GitHub one (optional)
matrix = "@john:doe.com" # Matrix username (MXID) of the person (optional)

[permissions]
# Optional, see the permissions documentation
```

The file must be named the same as the GitHub username.

## Teams

Each Rust team or working group is represented by a file in the `teams`
directory. The structure of the file is this:

```toml
name = "overlords"  # Name of the team, used for GitHub (required)
subteam-of = "gods"  # Name of the parent team of this team (optional)
# Set this to `true` if it is a top-level team, with a representative on the leadership-council.
top-level = true

# The kind of the team (optional). Could be:
# - team (default)
# - working-group
# - project-group
# - marker-team
kind = "working-group"

# Required, but it can be empty

    "craterbot",
    "rust-timer",
    # Any subset of members may hold custom roles, beyond "Team leader" which is
    # controlled by the `leads` array above. Members with roles are written
    # using an inline table as follows. A simple string member like "bors" is
    # equivalent to {github = "bors", roles = []}. The strings in `roles` must
    # be present as the `id` of some role in [[roles]] section below.
    { github = "Crab01", roles = ["cohost"] },
    { github = "Crab02", roles = ["cohost"] },
]
# Past members of the team. They will not be considered as part of the team,
# but they will be recognized on the website.

# which comprise only members of other teams via include-team-leads or similar.

## Permissions

Permissions can be applied either to a single person or to a whole team, and
they grant access to some pieces of rust-lang tooling. The following
permissions are available:

```toml
[permissions]
# All permissions are optional, including the `permissions` section

# Grants access to the @rust-timer GitHub bot
perf = true
# Grants access to the @craterbot GitHub bot
crater = true
# Grants admin access on crates.io
crates-io-admin = true
# Grants `@bors r+` rights in the repo `rust-lang/some-repo`
bors.some-repo.review = true
# Grants `@bors try` rights in the repo `rust-lang/some-repo`.
# This is a subset of `bors.some-repo.review`, so this shouldn't
# be set if `review` is also set.
bors.some-repo.try = true

# Access to the dev-desktop program.
# See https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/docs/dev-desktop.html
dev-desktop = true
```

## Repos

Repos are configured by creating a file in the `repos` folder
under the corresponding org directory. For example, the `rust-lang/rust`
repository is managed by the file "repos/rust-lang/rust.toml".
The following configuration options are available:

```toml
# The org this repo belongs to (required)
org = "rust-lang"
# The name of the repo (required)
name = "my-repo"
# A description of the repo (required)
description = "A repo for awesome things!"
# A URL that is displayed next to the description.
homepage = "https://www.rust-lang.org/"
# The bots that this repo requires (required)
bots = ["bors", "rustbot", "rust-timer"]

# The teams that have access to this repo along
# with the access level. (required)
# The key is the team name, and the value is either:
# - "triage"
# - "write"
# - "maintain"
# - "admin"
# Refer to https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-repository-roles/repository-roles-for-an-organization
# for information on permissions.
[access.teams]
compiler = "write"
mods = "maintain"

# Access granted to individuals. This should be avoided if possible, access
# should only be given to teams.
# The key is the GitHub username, and the value is the permission level (same as teams).
[access.individuals]
octocat = "write"

# The branch protections (optional)
# Refer to https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches
# for information on how branch protections work.
#
# The behavior depends on whether or not bors is enabled.
# If bors is not enabled, then this requires at least one approving review
# (via GitHub's PR UI).
# If bors is enabled, approvals via GitHub's UI is not required (since we
# count the `@bors r+` comment as an approval). Also, bors will be added to
# the "allowed pushers".
#
# Users with the "maintain" role or admins are allowed to merge PRs via the
# GitHub UI. If you have bors enabled, you should only give users the "write"
# role so that the "Merge" button is disabled, forcing the user to use the
# `@bors r+` comment instead.
#
# The branch protection also requires a PR to push changes. You cannot push
# directly to the branch.
#
# Admins cannot override these branch protections. If an admin needs to
# do that, they will need to temporarily edit the branch protection.
[[branch-protections]]
# The pattern matching the branches to be protected (required)
pattern = "master"
# Which CI checks to are required for merging (optional)
ci-checks = ["CI"]
# Whether new commits after a reviewer's approval of a PR 
# merging into this branch require another review. 
# (optional - default `false`)
dismiss-stale-review = false
# How many approvals are required for a PR to be merged.
# This option is only relevant if bors is not used.
# (optional - default `1`)
required-approvals = 1
# Which GitHub teams have access to push/merge to this branch.
# If unspecified, all teams/contributors with write or higher access
# can push/merge to the branch.
# (optional)
allowed-merge-teams = ["awesome-team"]
```
