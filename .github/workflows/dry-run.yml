# This workflow executes a dry-run of the sync-team tool after a push to any pull request.
# This allows us to see which changes would be applied to live services after the PR
# would be merged.
#
# The workflow uses the `workflow_run` trigger, which should always run in the default branch of
# this repository. This is required so that the workflow has permissions to post PR comments.
# We should not check out any code from the PR, as it could present a security hazard.
# Instead, we simply download a GitHub artifact with a directory of JSON files and use that as
# input for sync-team.
# This artifact is created and uploaded on PR pushes using the CI workflow in `main.yml`.
# Details about `workflow_run`:
