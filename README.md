| [Crater and @craterbot][crater] | *In real time* | [Integration source][crater-src] |
| [Perf and @rust-timer][perf] | *In real time* | [Integration source][perf-src] |
| [@rfcbot][rfcbot] | 5 minutes | [Integration source][rfcbot-src] |
| GitHub teams membership | *Shortly after merge* | [Integration source][sync-team-src] |
| GitHub repositories | *Shortly after merge* | [Integration source][sync-team-src] |
| Mailing lists and aliases (`@rust-lang.org`, `@crates.io`) | *Shortly after merge* | [Integration source][sync-team-src] |
| Zulip user group membership | *Shortly after merge* | [Integration source][sync-team-src] |
| [Governance section on the website][www] | 2 minutes | [Integration source][www-src] |
| crates.io admin access | 1 hour | [Integration source][crates-io-admin-src] |

If you need to add or remove a person from a team, send a PR to this
repository.  After it's merged, their account will be added/removed
from all the supported services.

## Using the CLI tool

It's possible to interact with this repository through its CLI tool.

### Verifying the integrity of the repository

This repository contains some sanity checks to avoid having stale or broken
data. You can run the checks locally with the `check` command:

```
cargo run check
```

Note that some of these checks will be skipped due to missing API tokens.

### Adding a person to the repository

It's possible to fetch the public information present in a GitHub profile and
store it in a person's TOML file:

```
cargo run add-person <github-username>
```

You can also add additional information, such as someone's Discord or Zulip ID by adding additional fields to their `.toml` file.

To determine someone's Zulip ID, find them in the list of people on the
right-hand side in Zulip, click the "three dots" menu and then "View profile", and copy the 'User ID'
into the toml file:

```
zulip-id = <user id>
```

### Querying information out of the repository

There are a few CLI commands that allow you to get some information generated
from the data in the repository.

You can get a list of all the people in a team:

```
cargo run dump-team all
```

You can get a list of all the email addresses subscribed to a list:

```
cargo run dump-list all@rust-lang.org
```

You can get a list of all the users with a permission:

```
cargo run dump-permission perf
```


You can generate [www.rust-lang.org](https://github.com/rust-lang/www.rust-lang.org)'s locales/en-US/tools.ftl file by running

```
cargo run dump-website
```

The website will automatically load new teams added here, however they cannot be translated unless `tools.ftl` is also updated.

You can also print a list of users with individual access to repositories

```
# Group the accesses by repository
cargo run dump-individual-access --group-mode repo

# Group the accesses by contributor
cargo run dump-individual-access --group-mode person
```


### Building the static API

You can build locally the content of `https://team-api.infra.rust-lang.org/v1/`
by running the command:

```
cargo run static-api output-dir/
```

The content will be placed in `output-dir/`.

### Encrypting email addresses

If an email address in a list needs to be confidential it's possible to encrypt
it. Encrypted email addresses look like this:

```
encrypted+3eeedb8887004d9a8266e9df1b82a2d52dcce82c4fa1d277c5f14e261e8155acc8a66344edc972fa58b678dc2bcad2e8f7c201a1eede9c16639fe07df8bac5aa1097b2ad9699a700edb32ef192eaa74bf7af0a@rust-lang.invalid
```

The production key is accessible to select Infrastructure Team members, so if
you need to add an encrypted email address you'll need to reach out to that
team. The key is stored in the following parameter on AWS SSM Parameter Store:

```
/prod/sync-team/email-encryption-key
```

The `cargo run encrypt-email` and `cargo run decrypt-email` interactive CLI
commands are available for infra team members to interact with encrypted
emails. The `rust_team_data` (with the `email-encryption` feature enabled) also
provides a module to programmatically encrypt and decrypt.
