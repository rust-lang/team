message = """
`rust_team_data/src/v1.rs` has been modified, it is used (as a git dependency) by multiple sub-projects like \
[triagebot](https://github.com/rust-lang/triagebot), the [www.rust-lang.org](https://github.com/rust-lang/www.rust-lang.org) website and others.

If you are changing the data structures, please make sure that the changes are not going to break serde deserialization \
(adding a field is fine; removing or renaming a field isn't).

If you must do a breaking change to the format, make sure to coordinate it with \
[all the users](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Arust-lang+%2Fname+%3D+%22rust_team_data%22%2F+NOT+repo%3Arust-lang%2Fteam+NOT+repo%3Arust-lang%2Fsync-team&type=code) \
of the `rust_team_data` crate.
